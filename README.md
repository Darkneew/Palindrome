# Palindrome
This code is my participation to the Replit Weekly Challenge 3

It takes a phrase in input, and then
 - tells you if it is a palindrome
 - if not, tells you how much moves needed to turn it into a palindrome
 - if impossible, tells you how much letters needed at the end to turn it into a palindrome
